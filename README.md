# sick-spence

I have scraped (manually, couldn't get Scrapy to work) text for 15 conditions ['fever', 'asthma', 'chronic_pain', 'cold', 'cramps', 'depression', 'diarrhea', 'dizziness', 'fatigue', 'headache', 'hypertension', 'nausea', 'rash', 'swelling', 'sleepiness']


I have created three files, each with a different approach.

# 1 

The first is term_frequency.py. Here I have used a simple term frequency count to build a document-term matrix and then calculate the overall cosine similarity of each condition with respect to the others. 

The overall similarities can be viewed in the "sims" dataframe generated towards the end. 

We see that "fever" and "cold" are relatively closely related compared to, say, "fever" and "cramps"

# 2

The second is tfidf.py. This one uses tf-idf vectorization instead of term frequency. The cosine similarities are also calculated for each condition with respect to the others.

Here also, we see a similar (but less stronger) relationship between "fever" and "cold"


# 3

The third is word2vec.py. Here, I have used word embeddings rather than a document-term matrix. The embeddings are generated by an inbuilt neural network and allow us to see what the most similar words are. 

For example, the most similar words to "fever" are - 
('fevers', 0.37741291522979736),
 ('sore', 0.30857762694358826),
 ('throat', 0.30036598443984985),
 ('temperature', 0.28681355714797974),
 ('flu', 0.2804933488368988),
 ('f', 0.27523359656333923),
 ('dehydration', 0.2722049355506897),
 ('hyperthermia', 0.25330662727355957),
 ('41', 0.24858561158180237),
 ('above', 0.24387159943580627)

Similarities among different conditions are also calculated -
Here also, we can see that there is a strong similarity between "fever" and "cold" and "fever" and "nausea" than between "fever" and "headache"
